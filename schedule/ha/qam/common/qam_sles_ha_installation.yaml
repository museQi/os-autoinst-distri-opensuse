  Install SLES+HA.
  Used on the maintenance process.

  In order to generate a qcow2 image with this schedule so it can be used by other tests,
  add the settings CREATE_HDD and set it to 1 and PUBLISH_HDD_1 and set it to the name
  of the qcow2 image to save; add these settings either in the job group configuration,
  test suite or command line. Also add PUBLISH_PFLASH_VARS on uefi scenarios.

  Add an SCC_REGISTER setting via job group configuration, command line or testsuite and
  set it to 'installation' so the SUT is registered to SCC, or set it to 'never' to skip
  registration. If setting it to 'never', also add an ADDONS setting defined to 'ha' so
  the HA extension is added during installation. The SCC_ADDONS setting is mandatory and
  it can only be defined in the job group configuration because it is dependent of the OS
  VERSION.

  For SLE15 systems, also set SYSTEM_ROLE to default, minimal or textmode depending on the test;
  do not leave it out as schedule can be used with either of the three values, but if default
  is not explicitly set, test will chose textmode system role as DESKTOP is set to textmode in the schedule.

  Below are optional settings.

  Set CHECK_PRESELECTED_MODULES to true to verify pre-selected modules during registration
  Use HDDMODEL to set the type of HDD, either virtio-blk, scsi-hd, etc.
  Set VIDEOMODE to text to perform text-based installation, must be set in the job group.
